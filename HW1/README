Hi Chris!
Formula.hs is a helper file used by both CNFBuild and FormReduce

The syntax for the parser is fairly intuitive. Example formula:
"p and q or (c -> !d)"

Compile CNFBuild with GHC, then run it and type in a formula. It will spit out a list of clauses in CNF.

Operate FormReduce similarly, but it computes SAT (and a truth assignment) or UNSAT using DPLL.
