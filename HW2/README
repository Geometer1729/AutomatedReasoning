Attached are Clause.hs and OR.hs;
Clause.hs contains the parser and some types, OR.hs is where the heavy lifting gets done.
Compile OR and run, then enter a formula like this:
p,q,!r.
s,t,!q.
p,s.

Entering a blank line ends the input. The periods are important.
The program will output the saturated (possibly empty) set of clauses.
